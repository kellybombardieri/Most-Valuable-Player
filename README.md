Horiseon home page on the job ticket hw assignment

# About the Project
This project is a home page for a company called Horiseon. On the homepage you will find header links that direct you to different sections of the page that include information on who the company is. 
I originally pulled this code from a GitLab repository and edited the HTML and CSS files to improve the code in order to make the website more accessible and to make sure all the links on the page worked correctly.  
The edits I did to make this website more accessible are adjusting the colour of the webpage and increasing text size in order to even out the contrast and make it readable for all parties. I also changed the html tags to be semantic, so they are identifiable, I corrected the links that did not respond how they were supposed to, added alt attributes to all image links so they have a description of what each image is, made sure the html and css flowed in sequential order and added a title to the website. 

# Built With
This project was built using HTML and CSS.

# Getting Started
To access this code you will need to have Visual Studio Code downloaded onto your device.

# Usage
Main issues you may notice when adjusting this code is that the links all follow a relative path so if you pull them into a new folder, to adjust the path to access the files.
